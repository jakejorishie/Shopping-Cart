    <p className="d-flex justify-content-center fs-4 lh-lg" style={{fontFamily: 'Kaisei Decol'}}>Cooper's Candles, husband-and-wife team who love making & creating and adore the lifestyle of coastal living.  When not making candles with our crew, we love spending time with our grandsons, Cruz and Henry, walking the beaches with our two fur babies, Chewbacca & Cleo, and exploring our beautiful coastal towns in New England.

Stacy started making candles in her basement in 2017 because Barry has asthma. After learning most common candles on the market are filled with toxic paraffin wax bases, she started experimenting with natural waxes. After a year of making candles as a craft for herself and her friends, paired with feeling that her career path was not meeting her desire to help people, Stacy came up with the idea of Cooper's Candles; a company that blended her loves (the sea and clean burning candles!), with a passion to help promote living a healthier lifestyle and giving back with environmental consciousness.

From Stacyâ€™s first handcrafted candle, to our respective exits from corporate worlds, we are now entrepreneurs who work side by side together and have turned a passion project into a life we love -- and we love sharing!

Cooper's Candles embodies a feeling -- inspired by a moment or place and designed with intention.  Our candle bar and boutique is inspiration for life and home - a curated collection of coastal-inspired products combined with a custom experience to help bring your memories alive through the art of scent blending and 'pouring your own'. 

We are so passionate about fragrance and helping you create a space you love, feel good about, and which reflects a life well lived!
